# Performance Analysis of a Low-Power High-Speed Hybrid Full Adder Circuit and Full Subtractor Circuit

This project focuses on the design and simulation of low-power, high-speed 1-bit full adder and full subtractor circuits using CMOS and pass-transistor logic.

## 📄 Project Description

The hybrid full adder combines EXNOR, CMOS, and transmission gate logic to achieve better power-delay performance.

Simulations were carried out using DSCH2 and Microwind tools.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- DSCH2
